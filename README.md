## Description

This assignment focuses on the implementation and experimentation of:

- **A* Search Algorithm**: Optimized pathfinding considering heuristics and optional backward cost.
- **Minimax Algorithm**: Decision-making in a deterministic environment (example: evaluating coffee quality).
- **Multiple Goal Search**: Handling problems where multiple targets need to be achieved.
- **Single Source Goal Search (SSG)**: Pathfinding from a single source to a target, with and without backward cost consideration.
